##Calender page##
###Instructions###
- We are coding to create a workday calender page that is able to organize and save the tasks you have to perform from 9-5. The page is interactive in the sense that it is color coated and shows what hour you currently are in the day.
###Technologies###
- We are using the 3 basic languages of coding(javascript, css and HTML) to create a fully function calender page on the web using VS code. Also used is bootstrap to help the stylistic features. Local storage is used to save, obtain and
provide previously entered inputs and tasks.
Launch- Basic functional computer with a web browser(google chrome) can be used to run this application
